# XUI 2

The XUI toolkit was born because we at RedStar Technologies (RSTHN) like very much to create web-based tools. And we often saw the need to have a standard way to define common UI elements to speed up our development process.

## Installation

Preferably install XUI globally since it has a command line interface (CLI) to manage and initialize your projects, note that XUI requires
Rin as peer dependency, which needs to be installed as well.

```sh
npm install @rsthn/rin
npm install -g @rsthn/xui --no-optional
```

## Components
