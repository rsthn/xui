# XUI 2

The XUI toolkit was born because we like very much to create web-based tools, and we often found the need to have a standard way to define common UI elements to speed up our development process.

## Installation

Preferably install XUI globally since it has a command line interface (CLI) to manage and initialize your projects.

```sh
npm install -g @rsthn/xui --no-optional
```

## Elements

The [ELEMENTS.md](./docs/ELEMENTS.md) file in the [docs](./docs/) folder contains all the currently available XUI elements and their respective documentation.
