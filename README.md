# XUI 2

The XUI toolkit was born because we at RedStar Technologies (RSTHN) like very much to create web-based tools. And we often saw the need to have a standard way to define common UI elements to speed up our development process.

## Installation

Preferably install XUI globally since it has a command line interface (CLI) to manage and initialize your projects.

`npm install -g @rsthn/xui`

## Components

View the ELEMENTDS.md file to view all currently available XUI components and how to use them.
